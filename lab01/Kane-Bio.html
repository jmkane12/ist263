    <body>
        My name is Joshua Kane and I am currently attending Syracuse University. I am an Information Management & Technology major in the iSchool and am interested in software development. Some recent accomplishments I have recently obtained is I just finished an internship job at Amphenol working as an IT/Financial analyst. I was able to improve my communication and technological skills while working here. Outside of work and school I love to stay as active as possible. I am always either working out, hanging out with friends, or playing sports such as basketball, lacrosse, or golf.
